# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam Wight. I'm a CS student at The University of Alabama and a React, Rails, and Typescript/Javascript developer by trade, but you'll find me coding in pretty much any language I can. I'm the president of **Blueprint at UA**, a student organization that donates software development consulting services to local nonprofits. Previously, I served as the Executive of Development for **CrimsonHacks**, the first MLH-sponsored hackathon in the state of Alabama. I also served as the Front-End Team Manager at CrimsonHacks my freshman year.

Professionally, I work as a full-stack React and Rails developer, but I have experience in multiple languages and frameworks, including **Javascript** / **Typescript**, **Node**, **Meteor**, **PHP**, **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **React**, **Vue**, and many others. Feel free to check out my GitHub or my LinkedIn above for more examples of my work.
